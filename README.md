# DarkEden Docker
Set up your very own server using a current technology (vm is pretty dead boysssss) with a few steps. Everyone wants to make your own server, by gets stuck on VPS princing. Why is that? Too expansive. But Why [Docker]? Well, docker works like a VM, but without a Operating System behind. But why this matter? Well... You can execute a 'vm like' with less resources of memory, cpu, etc.

# NOT WORKING YET. [Why]? 
 - Error: When user do the login and goes to the character selection, GameServer process starts over.

# About Docker and the Project:
Read our [wiki].

# Build
### Dependencies
```sh
$ sudo apt install docker
```

### Runinng
Easy peasy lemon squeezy steps. Just run these commands below (```-d``` means "Run container in background and print container ID", ```-P``` means "Publish a containerâ€™s port(s) to the host", ```-e``` means "Set environment variables", ```-v``` means "Bind mount a volume". You can learn more about arguments [here].):
```sh
$ cd DarkEden-Docker/
sudo docker build -t dk .                                          #THIS WILL BUILD THE IMAGE LABELED AS 'dk'.
CONTAINER=`sudo docker run -d -P -e "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=123" -v "/home/pmateus/DarkEden-With-Docker/data/:/home/darkeden/vs/data" dk`  #THIS WILL RUN THE IMAGE CALLED 'dk'
CONTAINER=`sudo docker run -d -p 9999:9999/tcp -p 9999:9999/udp -p 9998:9998/tcp -p 9998:9998/udp -p 9997:9997/tcp -p 9997:9997/udp -p 9996:9996/tcp -p 9996:9996/udp -p 9977:9977/tcp -p 9977:9977/udp -p 9900:9900/tcp -p 9900:9900/udp -p 9800:9800/tcp -p 9800:9800/udp -p 5001:5001/tcp -p 5001:5001/udp -p 5000:5000/tcp -p 5000:5000/udp -p 3001:3001/tcp -p 3001:3001/udp -p 2999:2999/tcp -p 2999:2999/udp -p 1111:1111/tcp -p 1111:1111/udp -e "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=123" -v "/home/matt/dkworkspace/DarkEden-With-Docker/data/:/home/darkeden/vs/data" dk`  #THIS WILL RUN THE IMAGE CALLED 'dk'
sudo docker exec -it ${CONTAINER} /bin/bash                        #THIS WILL OPEN THE CONTAINER CALLED 'CONTAINER_ID'
```

Now what? Inside the docker image (REALLY lightwave), just setup and start your server ;]
```sh
cd / && ./setup.sh   #This is for darkeden sql scripts. Just run this ONCE.
cd / && ./start      #You know that, right? :)
```

### Customizable
Open file ```Dockerfile``` and change these variables as you wish. Importante 1: The local server's ip will be set automatically and printed on terminal after build is complete. Important 2: DO NOT remove ```\``` from variables end line:

```
...
DB_USERNAME=dk \                 #database username (maybe elcastle? hehehe)
DB_PASSWORD=dk123 \              #database password (what about 'elca110'? recommended change!)

ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \           #username default account (admin privileges) on dk server
ADMIN_PASSWORD=123456 \          #password default account (admin privileges) on dk server

DK_SERVER_NAME=DKDocker \        #dk server name showing on client (World and Subworld)
...
```


# Done so far on server
